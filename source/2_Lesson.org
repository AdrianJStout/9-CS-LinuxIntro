- To get the most out of Linux, you'll want to learn to use the command line to get things done. Linux is based around an operating system called UNIX that was first devised and written in 1969. Computers weren't really used with mice, touch screens or graphics back then. Many used printers to produce their output rather than a monitor. 
- Many of the commands you'll learn are unchanged since the original UNIX release. Depite these commands possibly being older than your parents, they are used daily on the vast majority of the World's most powerful computers. 
- In this lesson, we'll learn to navigate around your files and look at what's in them. 
- Open the Linux VM using the link on your desktop, and log in using your network username and password. 
- Once in, open a Terminal session. You'll have a window open that looks a little like this...
[[./img/term.png]]
- We'll start by moving into a new directory (or folder as you might say in Windows), downloading some files from the web and then navigating through them.
- One by one, copy and paste these lines into your terminal...
#+begin_src
cd ~/Documents
mkdir Linux_Work
cd Linux_Work
git clone https://github.com/stsb11/9-CS-LinuxIntro-files.git
cd 9-CS-LinuxIntro-files/treasure
#+end_src

- What we've just done is...
   - Change Directory into 'Documents'.
   - MaKe a new DIRectory called /LinuxWork/. 
   - Change Directory into /LinuxWork/.
   - Download some files from a website called 'GitHub.com'
   - Change Directory into the directory containing these files we just downloaded.

- We're going on a treasure hunt.
- In the treasure directory that you're currently in, there are more directories and some files within them. 
- Many of these files contain jokes. One of them contains a secret code that you can use to collect your silver badge for this lesson. 
- You'll need to learn to use three commands to complete this exercise.
#+begin_src
pwd
#+end_src
- Present Working Directory. Outputs the current directory you're in.

- *Silver:* Write a set of rules for someone who has never played '21' before so that they will always win.
- *Gold:* Write a working two-player game of 21 in Scratch. Upload a screenshot of your code AND the *.sb2* file to the upload points. 
- *Platinum:* Implement a one-player version with a computer opponent. 
   - The computer should randomly choose to play either a 1, 2 or 3. 
   - If you can do this, see if you can implement a strategy that means the computer will always win when it goes first.
