- When on a computer system, users will need to be able to edit files. 
- Most files contain plain text with no images of video embedded in them (e.g. HTML files, .txt files, .py files). These can be modified by programs called text editors.
- There are various text editors available on Linux systems, and hackers typically have [[https://stallman.org/saint.html][strong feelings]] about their favourite. 
- Some examples are:
   - Nano
   - vim
   - emacs (always with a lower case e)
   - gedit
- The Internet community is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war][divided]] as to whether emacs or vim is better.
- You can make your own mind up on this. We use emacs to author everything you see on [[https://www.bournetocode.com][BourneToCode.com]] and [[https://www.bournetoinvent.com][BourneToInvent.com]] though. 
- Although originally written for UNIX-like systems, most of the above editors are also availale for other operating systems, like Windows.

- Emacs was written back in 1976 by a software engineer called Richard Stallman. He's quite the character in his own right; you can read more about him on his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman][Wikipedia page]]. 
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Emacs_Dired_buffers.png]]
- Despite being nearly 40 years old, emacs continues to be actively developed by the online community, and is one of the oldest computer applications in the World still in active use.

- emacs was written for an era in computer science where the keyboard was the only way to enter commands onto a computer and graphics consisted of text appearing on a text-only terminal. 
- While superficially, it might seem daunting to enter text without a mouse, but many professional developers find that when one works without ever having to take their hands off the keyboard, they are able to work far more quickly. 
[[./img/3_1.png]]
- Load up emacs either by loading it from the applications menu or by typing =emacs= in the terminal. They both work the same way, but the version you load with the mouse will also allow you to use the mouse to navigate around documents. The screen will look like the image above.


- We'll create a quick web page to get to grips with working on a file.
- emacs uses (about 2000) keyboard shortcuts to allow users to achieve all manner of activities. We'll only need a tiny number of these to get some productive work done. 
- In emacs, shortcuts are either achieved by holding the Control key and pressing another key, or holding the meta key (Alt) and tapping another key. 
- The shorthand for this looks like this: C-x C-f.
- This would mean to Hold Control and tap =x=, then to hold Control and tap =f=. You don't need to release the control key each time, but you can if you want to.
- Type =C-x, C-f= which is the combination to open a new file.
[[./img/3_2.png]]
- At the bottom of the screen, the computer will show you the =~/= prompt, which is inviting you to enter the name of the file you'd like to open or create. 
- Type =newfile.html= and hit enter to make a new, empty HTML file.
- Paste this into the new, empty document...

- If you've a Scratch account, you can sign in to save the work you'll do here.
- If you've not got one, you can always click 'File -> Download to your computer' when you're finished to ensure your work is saved.
- Unfortunately, it looks like the developer didn't have time to finish the code, and there are some blanks. 
- Based on the rules set out above, can you complete the code and make the game work?

*** Silver
- Complete the code for the game.
*** Gold
- Modify the cat's strategy to be an 'angel'. It always stays silent, and never betrays the human player. 
- Develop a new 'Unpredictable puss' strategy for the cat, so that it betrays or stays silent at random. 
*** Platinum
- Modify the cat's strategy so that it holds a grudge...
- It will remain silent every time the game is played, until the human player betrays, then...
- It will then always betray the human player until the game is reset.
