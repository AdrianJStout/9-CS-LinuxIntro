- *NOTE: DON'T DO THESE STEPS IF YOU'RE USING THE BROWSER VERSION OF LINUX*
- Double click the Ubuntu icon on your desktop, and wait for it to boot.
- Enter your normal network username and password.
- Once you are presented with a prompt, enter *startx* and hit enter to start a graphical session.
- You'll need to log in as yourself once more.
- Open a Terminal session by clicking the "Activities" button in the top-left corner, then typing "Terminal" and hitting enter. 
- You'll have a window open that looks a little like this...
[[./img/term.png]]
- We'll start by moving into a new directory (or folder as you might say in Windows), downloading some files from the web and then navigating through them.
- One by one, copy and paste these lines into your terminal...
#+begin_src
cd ~/Documents
mkdir Linux_Work
cd Linux_Work
git clone https://github.com/stsb11/9-CS-LinuxIntro-files.git
cd 9-CS-LinuxIntro-files/treasureHunt
#+end_src

- What we've just done is...
   - Change Directory into 'Documents'.
   - MaKe a new DIRectory called /LinuxWork/. 
   - Change Directory into /LinuxWork/.
   - Download some files from a website called 'GitHub.com'
   - Change Directory into the directory containing these files we just downloaded.
